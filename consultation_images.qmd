### Why? 

Improve your image analysis in collaboration with the bioDSC.


### What do we offer?

We offer concrete input on your image analysis problem. For example:

-	A short script with a working example
-	Suitable metrics to quantify your biological phenotypes
-	Recommendations for analysis software and approaches

As an indication, we aim to spend 1-2 afternoons to review your materials and then offer 1-2 hours of discussion. Further collaboration may be possible depending on mutual interest and feasibility.

### How to join?

Send us an e-mail ([info@biodsc.nl](mailto:info@biodsc.nl)) including:

-	A short summary of the broader project and research question (±1-3 sentences)
-	A brief description of what you aim to achieve with your images (±1-5 sentences)

### Example questions:

-	What’s the best way to extract a specific parameter from an image?
-	I’m currently manually annotating/segmenting data, can it be automated?
-	I want to analyze microscopy images—what tools should I use?
-	How can I best plot / visualize my data?
-	Can I save time by automating parts of my analysis?
-	Could you review my current analysis approach/script?
-	How can I design my pilot experiment to be suitable for image analysis?

### Who?

PhDs, Postdocs, PIs, everyone with image analysis challenges can contact us.
