# Additional exercises Lesson 8, dataframes (2)


### Epicardial cells

#### A

In the RNA-seq data, we can create another column that reflects the condition
of the cells, WT or mutant. Fill in the blanks to achieve this:

```python
df_cells_kohela2['Condition'] = ____

df_cells_kohela2.loc[df_cells_kohela2.index.str.contains('WT_'), 'Condition'] = ____
df_cells_kohela2.loc[df_cells_kohela2.index._______, _________] = ______
```

<!--
# SOLUTION
df_cells_kohela2['Condition'] = 'unknown'
df_cells_kohela2.loc[df_cells_kohela2.index.str.contains('WT_'), 'Condition'] = 'WT'
df_cells_kohela2.loc[df_cells_kohela2.index.str.contains('mutant_'), 'Condition'] = 'mutant'
-->

#### B

What is the difference between str.contains and str.match?

#### C

Now again calculate the mean value of TFAP2A expression in WT cells vs. mutant cells. 
Does there appear to be more TFAP2A expression in the mutant cells?

<!--
# SOLUTION
df_cells_kohela2.loc[:,['TFAP2A','Condition']].groupby('Condition').mean()
-->

### Gene expression (bioDSC)

- Convert the data below to a file you can import (e.g.: csv, tsv), import it to a pandas df, and determine the following:
    - The average CRP gene expression per condion.
    - The corresponding standard deviations.
    - The log2-fold change between WT, condition A, and condition B.
    - Do the same for ACTA1.
    - Normalize all gene expression levels to their average respective wild type levels.

```
gene	expression	condition
CRP	873	WT
CRP	324	WT
CRP	214	WT
CRP	151	WT
CRP	1220	A
CRP	450	A
CRP	300	A
CRP	210	A
CRP	800	B
CRP	200	B
CRP	200	B
CRP	130	B
ACTA1	7457	WT
ACTA1	2342	WT
ACTA1	8000	WT
ACTA1	9000	WT
ACTA1	6500	A
ACTA1	2200	A
ACTA1	7500	A
ACTA1	8000	A
ACTA1	1000	B
ACTA1	1123	B
ACTA1	3211	B
ACTA1	1231	B
```

### GDPs (bioDSC)

- Between '87 and '92 the GDP of most countries took a hit. Are there any countries which had a positive increase between those two years? Which ones?
- Calculate the average GDP between all European countries per year.
    - Normalize the dataframe by this trend.


### Exploring available methods using the dir() function

Python includes a dir() function that can be used to display all of the available methods (functions) that are built into a data object. In Episode 4, we used some methods with a string. But we can see many more are available by using dir():

```python
my_string = 'Hello world!'   # creation of a string object 
dir(my_string)
```

This command returns:

```python
['__add__',
...
'__subclasshook__',
'capitalize',
'casefold',
'center',
...
'upper',
'zfill']
```

You can use help() or Shift+Tab to get more information about what these methods do.

Assume Pandas has been imported and the Gapminder GDP data for Europe has been loaded as data. Then, use dir() to find the function that prints out the median per-capita GDP across all European countries for each year that information is available.

### Interpretation

Polandâ€™s borders have been stable since 1945, but changed several times in the years before then. How would you handle this if you were creating a table of GDP per capita for Poland for the entire twentieth century?
