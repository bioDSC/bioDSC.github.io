# Exercises Lesson 4, functions (1)

### Order

- Explain in simple terms the order of operations in the following program: when does the addition happen, when does the subtraction happen, when is each function called, etc.
- What is the final value of radiance?

```Python
radiance = 1.0
radiance = max(2.1, 2.0 + min(radiance, 1.1 * radiance - 0.5))
```

### Last string character

If Python starts counting from zero, and len returns the number of characters in a string, what index expression will get the last character in the string name? (Note: we will see a simpler way to do this in a later episode.)

### Why not?

Why is it that max and min do not return None when they are called with no arguments?

### Spot the difference

Predict what each of the print statements in the program below will print.
Does max(len(rich), poor) run or produce an error message? If it runs, does its result make any sense?

```Python
easy_string = "abc"
print(max(easy_string))
rich = "gold"
poor = "tin"
print(max(rich, poor))
print(max(len(rich), len(poor)))
```
