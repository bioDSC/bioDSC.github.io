# Additional Exercises Lesson 13, Conditionals

### List comprehension (bioDSC)

#### A

Adapt the following code to select only positive values:

```python
example_list = [1,2,3,4,-5,1,34,6,-10, 39]
example_list_pos = [___ for item in example_list if ___]
print(example_list_pos)
```

#### B

Use the same code, but:
- select values between 30 and 40
- select items <0 or >10

#### C

Use a np.array (see additional exercises Lesson 3) to do the same more elegantly.

### Enumerate, zip (bioDSC)

These exercises introduce two new concepts. 
You might need google.

#### A

What does the following code do? What is the meaning of the output?

```
for idx, item in enumerate([1,2,3,4,-5,1,34,6,-10]):
    
    if item>5:
        print(idx)
```

#### B

Modify the following code such that it will compare each item i in apples with each item i in pears, and tell you which one is heavier.
You need to edit the code.

```
apples = [123, 436, 123, 654, 117, 193, 120]
pears  = [543, 163, 178, 165, 123, 187, 190]

for apple_weight, pear_weight in zip(apples, pears):
    print('='*10)
    print('weigth apple: ', apple_weight)
    print('weigth pear: ',pear_weight)
    
    print('the XXX is heavier')
```


### Initializing

Modify this program so that it finds the largest and smallest values in the list no matter what the range of values originally is.

```python
values = [...some test data...]
smallest, largest = None, None
for v in values:
    if ____:
        smallest, largest = v, v
    ____:
        smallest = min(____, v)
        largest = max(____, v)
print(smallest, largest)
```

What are the advantages and disadvantages of using this method to find the range of the data?


**bioDSC hints**

The loop could also look as follows:

```python
values = [...some test data...]
smallest, largest = None, None
for v in values:
    smallest = min(____, v)
    largest = max(____, v)
```

Why wouldn't this work?

This is why the if statement is needed. 

How can we test whether we are in the first iteration?
