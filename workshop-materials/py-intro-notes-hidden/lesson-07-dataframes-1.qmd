# Lesson 7, Pandas dataframes (1)
  
```python
# Pandas is statistics library
    # works with tabular data
    # very similar to R's dataframes
        # ("borrows features")
        
# Dataframe
    # 2D table
        # columns have names
        # columns might have different types
        
# we will read in a datafile from .csv format
    # check out what's in the file
    
import pandas as pd

# data_oceania = pd.read_csv('../data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv')
data_oceania = pd.read_csv('/Users/m.wehrens/Data_UVA/2024_teaching/2025-03-gapminder/data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv')
print(data_oceania)
    # Note: "\" is used when too wide for screen
    # Note: use convenient names, 
        # Prevent accidental mixups
    
# Typical for dataframe:
    # Columns are observed variables
    # Rows are observations

```


```python

# Currently, 1st column is country name
    # want to make that row name
    # set parameter "index_col" 
    
data_oceania_country = pd.read_csv('/Users/m.wehrens/Data_UVA/2024_teaching/2025-03-gapminder/data/gapminder_gdp_oceania.csv',\
     index_col='country')
     
     # index_col should be column name as a string
     
print(data_oceania_country)

# convenient methods:

data_oceania_country.info()
    # Gives summary of df
        # two rows; "Australia" and "New Zealand"
        # twelve columns, 
            # also their types are listed
            # (null count talked about later)
            # memory usage also listed
```

```python
# DataFrame.columns
    # stores information about columns
    # this is a PARAMETER
        # similar to math.pi

data_oceania_country.columns

# don't do:
# data_oceania_country.columns()

# .columns is called "member variable" or "member"

# Transpose
    # what if we want to swap the x,y axes (columns and rows)?
        # use:

data_oceania_country.T
    # (for all intents and purposes) member variable
```

```python
# to get summary statistics

data_oceania_country.describe()
    # includes all columns with numerical data
    # not useful 2 rows, but very when many
```
