### Workshops we gave and workshops we're working on

Below a list of past and planned workshops. We aim to give workshops based on demand. So if there's enough people interested, workshops will be recurring.

#### Planned workshops

- Image analysis with Python (planning: Sept 2025).
    - Basics of working with images
    - Image manipulation, cellular segmentation, and other often-used concepts.
    - (..)
- Analysis of RNA-sequencing data (planning: Sept 2025)
    - Read quality control
    - Mapping reads to a reference genome
    - Differentially expressed gene analysis using `DEseq2` in R.

#### Past workshops

- An introduction to Python ([March](2025-introduction-python.qmd), [April](2025-introduction-python-2.qmd) & [May](2025-introduction-python-3.qmd) 2025). 
    - Variables, types, basic commands, functions, libraries.
    - Working with tabular data (Pandas).
    - Plotting (matplotlib).
    - Using loops and conditionals, writing functions.
    - Good practices in programming and software engineering.
- [Bring your own data](2025-BYOD-1.html) (February 25th, 2025)
    - Bring your own dataset and make publication-quality figures.
- [An introduction to R](2025-introduction-R.qmd) (Jan 2025)

## Should I learn Python or R?

See the blog post about [Python vs. R](../posts/python-or-R.qmd) in case you're wondering whether you should start learning: R, or Python.

<!--
## Timing, pilot

We're currently working on the [Introduction to R](2025-introduction-R.qmd) workshop. This will be the first (pilot) workshop we'll be organizing, and it will give us better estimates of how long it takes to develop the course and prepare for the workshop. After this, we'll start planning more workshops. We aim to offer more workshops Â±4-6 weeks after the one in Jan 2025, but this is a rough estimate.
