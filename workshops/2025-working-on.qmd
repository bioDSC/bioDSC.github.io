### Workshops we're working on

We are currently aiming to soon offer the following workshops:

- An introduction to R (already planned for Jan 2025)
    - Basics of R
    - Importing, manipulating and analyzing data (mostly using dataframes). 
    - Plotting using ggplot.
- An introduction to Python, will likely cover 
    - Equivalents of concepts mentioned in the R intro course mentioned above.
- Image analysis with python, will likely cover:
    - Basics of working with images
    - Image manipulation, cellular segmentation, and other often-used concepts.
    - (..)
- Analysis of RNA-sequencing data using R
    - (..)

We aim to give workshops based on demand. So if there's enough people interested, workshops will be recurring.

## Should I learn Python or R?

See the blog post about [Python vs. R](../posts/python-or-R.qmd) in case you're wondering whether you should start learning: R, or Python.

## Timing, pilot

We're currently working on the [Introduction to R](2025-introduction-R.qmd) workshop. This will be the first (pilot) workshop we'll be organizing, and it will give us better estimates of how long it takes to develop the course and prepare for the workshop. After this, we'll start planning more workshops. We aim to offer more workshops Â±4-6 weeks after the one in Jan 2025, but this is a rough estimate.
