#### Info

I obtained my BSc at the Noordelijke Hogeschool (NHL) in Leeuwarden majoring in analytical chemistry and got my MSc in Computational Chemistry at the Radboud University in Nijmegen. After several jobs in commercial companies I continued my academic career in 2009 and obtained my PhD at the Leiden University on quantitative aspects in/of high resolution mass spectrometry data in metabolomics in 2014. In that same year I started as a post-doc at the BDA group working on aspects of multi-block/view solutions like JIVE, DISCO and OnPLS and incorporating these types of methods in the prediction/classification of in-vivo transcriptome data. After another PD position at the Amsterdam Medical Center I started as a data scientist in the [BDA group](https://bdagroup.nl){target="_blank"} in 2019. 

Current activities concern administration and implementation of a local Galaxy Server. Development of a database to store meta-data on samples/measurements (Metatree). Deployment of DL tools in the deconvolution of HRMS data and learning from DL models in general.

My main interest is in (pre)processing of large data-sets (with a preference for high resolution mass spectrometry data) and the development and implementation of data-analysis and pre-processing tools that is often further complicated because of these large data sizes.

#### Keywords:
Python, C++, C, Matlab, (R), Java, Galaxy(project), Metabolomics, MS, (multivariate) data analysis, (learning from) DL models.
