R is a programming language for statistical programming and data visualation, and is very popular in the field of biology. Chances are high that those nice figures you see in papers were generated in R! In addition, understanding the basics of R sets you up for more complex data-heavy analysis such as the analysis of RNA-seq data.\nThis workshop assumes no prior knowledge on R or programming!\n\n\nWorkshop learning outcomes\nAfter this workshop, you will be familiar with R, RStudio, and programming in general. More specifically, you will learn about:\n\nBasic R syntax, how to write your first scripts\nLoading datasets and manipulating data\nMake plots based on your data (using ggplot2)\n\n\n\nWorkshop logistics\nThe course will be given by Martijn Wehrens and Misha Paauw from the bioDSC. There is room for 4-12 participants. You have to bring your own laptop, with and R and RStudio installed: instructions can be found here under section “Setup instructions”. If you run into problems installing R before the workshop, please come in 30 minutes in advance so we can help you set-up your laptop for the workshop.\nWe will use course materials from The Carpentries, an initiative to teach foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.\n\n\nWorkshop schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nTime\nLocation\nTopic\n\n\n\n\n15 january\n12:30 - 13:00\nScience Park B0.201\nWalk-in and R installation helpdesk\n\n\n15 january\n13:00 - 17:00\nScience Park B0.201\nIntroduction to R, part 1\n\n\n17 january\n13:00 - 17:00\nScience Park B0.201\nIntroduction to R, part 2\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up\nSign up here.

    "text": "Martijn Wehrens\n\nAfter studying biology and chemistry in Nijmegen (BSc, RU), I obtained a MSc degree in theoretical chemistry at the University of Amsterdam, during which I focussed on simulations of biomolecular networks. Remaining in Amsterdam, I then obtained my PhD at AMOLF, where I worked on tracking single bacteria using time lapse microscopy to understand gene regulation at the single cell. After finishing my PhD, I moved to the Hubrecht Institute in Utrecht where I used RNA-sequencing to investigate the pathogenesis of heart disease as a postdoc.\nAt the bioDSC, I have fun writing scripts and lending my various computational and quantitative expertise to further understand all the amazing biological processes that occur in cells.\n\nKeywords:\nImage analysis, quantitative biology, RNA-seq and sequencing pipelines, data analysis in Python and R.\n\n\nContact:\nGroup: Molecular Cytology\nOffice: SP C2.267a\nEmail: m.wehrens@uva.nl"

    "text": "Misha Paauw\n\n\nInfo\nAfter a broad training in biology during my BSc and MSc, ranging from ecology to bioinformatics to molecular plant biology, I started my PhD in the Molecular Plant Pathology group of the University of Amsterdam in 2019. In my PhD research, I worked on the molecular interactions between plants and a pathogenic bacterium, called Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc). By studying the ‘pangenome’ of Xcc, I reconstructed the evolutionary history of Xcc and pinpointed the genes required for the specific infection strategy of Xcc.\nIn my current role as data scientist I support molecular biologists in their data-heavy projects by providing individual consultancy and organizing workshops via the bioDSC.\n\n\nKeywords:\nPython, R, bash, data visualisation, comparative genomics, microbial genomics, molecular (plant) biology.\n\n\nContact:\nGroup: Plant Physiology, Green Life Sciences\nOffice: SP C2-207\nEmail: m.m.paauw@uva.nl"
